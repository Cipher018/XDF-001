## Introduction

### Objectives

The objective of this project is to create an experimental drone based on the ESP32 ecosystem architecture, utilizing a radio frequency communication protocol and integrating an open-source application for real-time telemetry and video visualization, with the capability to link with Excel or SQL databases. Additionally, the project aims to test the implementation of simple autonomous functions such as flight path planning, point orbiting, and more complex actions like payload release, based on vector and geometric operations.

### Motivation

The primary motivation for this project stems from a passion for military aviation and a desire to address the economic barriers present in modern aeromodelling. Developing a drone within the ESP32 ecosystem opens doors for iterating this architecture across various projects. While this specific project entails a higher cost due to its platform dimensions, any subsequent iteration on micro-drones or smaller-sized drones would be significantly more cost-effective.

Another motivation is to utilize this drone in various applications such as surveillance, package delivery, or aerobatic exhibitions, leveraging its aerodynamic and acrobatic design.
